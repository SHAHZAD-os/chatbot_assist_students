By looking at the curriculum \\none can judge the state of intellectual development and the state of progress of a nation. The world \\nhas turned into a global village; new ideas and information are pouring in like a stream. It is, therefore, \\nimperative to update the curricula of our degree programs  regularly by introducing recent \\ndevelopments in the relevant fields of knowledge. In pursuance of this  goal, the Higher Education \\nCommission (HEC) is continually performing curricula  revision in collaboration with universities. \\nAccording to the decision of the special meeting of Vice-Chancellors Committee, curriculum of each \\nsubject must be reviewed after every 3 years.  \\n \\nThe curriculum, with varyin g definitions, is said to be a plan of the teaching -learning process that \\nstudents of an academic program are required to undergo to achieve some specific objectives.

Since knowledge in all disciplines and fields is expanding at a fast pace \\nand new disciplines are also emerging; it is imperative that curricula be developed and revised  \\naccordingly. \\n \\nIn compliance with the above provisions, the Curriculum Division of HEC undertakes the revision of \\ncurricula regularly through respective National Curriculum Revision Committees  (NCRCs) and \\nAccreditation Councils that consist of eminent professors, researchers, and practitioners of the relevant \\nfields from public and private sector universities, R&D organizations, councils, industry , and civil \\nsociety by seeking nominations from their  organizations.

The quality and competence of graduates and their relevance \\nis critical for socio-economic uplift and manpower required to meet the needs of the country. HEC’s \\nNational Computing Education Accreditation Council (NCEAC) is the Regulatory Body established  \\nby HEC to undertake multiple tasks to facilitate computing education in the country and devise steps \\nto enhance its quality . The quality of computing programs is ensured through a comprehensive \\nprocess that includes relevance of curricula, adaptation of international best practices, accreditation, \\ntrainings, and etc.  \\nRecently, a roundtable conference was held in Islamabad to discuss the impediments in IT/Computer \\nScience curriculum and bringing it at par with international standards and to meet the industry/'), Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\HB LAPTOP POINT\\\\Desktop\\\\New folder (2)\\\\backend\\\\BS Curriculm Computing Disciplines-2023.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='employer needs.

Accordingly, it involves development of technologies and techniques  via \\nhardware, software, and communication. Moreover, innovative, and limitless applications of \\ncomputing pertain to designing  and building of hardware and software systems  for a variety of \\npurposes. Additionally, it deals with the automatic  processing, protection, management and \\nstructuring of a whole range of information in different formats.

I can try to help with that.  However, based on the context, it is possible that \"Programming Fundamentals\" could be a prerequisite for a course that covers OOP, but this is not explicitly stated.  Therefore, I will answer that there is no information provided about the prereq of OOP.  If you need more information about the course structure or the curriculum, please let me know.  I can try to help with that.  The course \"Programming Fundamentals\" (CS1xx) is a Computing Core course with 4 credits and 3 hours of lectures and 3 hours of tutorials.  It is listed as a common course in Table no. 7.1.  However, there is no information provided about the specific course that covers OOP or its prerequisites.  If you need more information about the course structure or the curriculum, please let me know.  I can try to help with that.  I do not have enough information to answer the question about the prereq of OOP.  If you need more information about the\n"
